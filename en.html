                        <span>In 2015, we joined forces with a group of national figures and civil society activists during the Lebanon protests sparked by government negligence, which led to streets being flooded with waste. At that time, I personally submitted a proposal to the Lebanese government—supported by German funding—to address the waste crisis by converting waste into electrical energy in compliance with environmental standards, without imposing any cost on the Lebanese state. Unfortunately, sectarian quotas and widespread corruption within state institutions prevented the realization of this important development project for Lebanon, as has often been the case.</span>
