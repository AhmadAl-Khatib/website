                        <span>We participated with a group of national figures and civil society in the 2015 Lebanon protests resulting from government negligence that flooded streets with waste. At that time, I personally presented a proposal to the Lebanese government (with German funding) to address the waste crisis and convert it into a source of income by transforming it into electrical energy according to environmental standards without costing the Lebanese state a single penny. However, sectarian quotas and rampant corruption in state institutions prevented the realization of this development project for Lebanon as usual.</span>

When we noticed some disruptive attempts to hijack this sincere popular wave and divert it from its path, we established the 17 October Popular Bloc to preserve the civilized face of the movement and confront attempts to divert it from the people's legitimate demands, chaired by Dr. Khaled Hanqir, and I served as Secretary-General of the Bloc.</span>
