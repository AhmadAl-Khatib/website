                        <h3>The Age of Technology and Artificial Intelligence</h3>
                        <p>Since the beginning of the 21st century, we have been witnessing a massive digital surge, manifested in a new technological era, complementary to the digital revolution that began in the middle of the last century with the first appearance of the computer. This new era is represented by advanced intelligent electronic applications that are invading, expanding, and becoming deeply rooted in our lives, in parallel with a qualitative development in the field of smart mobile devices that have become available to everyone, spreading among the peoples of the world like wildfire.</p>
                        <p>This new technological era—the era of smart devices and applications—has left a profound and deep impact on our modern lifestyle, and was a reason for making it easier on various fronts... For example, who among us does not use the <strong>WhatsApp</strong> application and even depends on it for many of their daily tasks? Whether for chatting with family and friends, or for work and communicating with customers... This question also applies to many other applications that have permeated our lives and taken up a large part of them, from the <strong>Google</strong> application and the ease of accessing information, to <strong>Facebook</strong> and <strong>Twitter</strong> and the social media revolution, to <strong>ChatGPT</strong> and <strong>ChatSonic</strong> and the artificial intelligence surge... and other applications whose role and influence have grown, becoming a vital daily need and a lifestyle that is difficult to give up...</p>

                        <h3>The Importance of Programming</h3>
                        <p>The deep impact that this era has left on aspects of our lives is an indication of the great importance of the sciences through which this great technology has become available to us, which are the computer sciences, of which we will discuss a fundamental - and fun - branch in our book: the science of <strong>programming</strong>. As a more comprehensive indication of the importance of programming and its pivotal role in this age, let's take this example to predict what might happen if—for some reason—all software systems in a country were to fail:</p>
                        <p>The occurrence of such a grim scenario would likely lead to: government departments shutting down and citizens being unable to complete transactions, the internet and wireless communications failing, banks, factories, companies, airplanes, high-speed trains, etc. ceasing to operate... In short, it is a catastrophic scenario that resembles the paralysis of life's manifestations... In the age of digital technology we live in, most work has come to depend fundamentally and pivotally on computer technology and programming, and therefore, programming has become a vital basic need of this era.</p>

                        <h3>The Increasing Demand for Programming</h3>
                        <p>This great importance that programming has taken on has led to a huge increase in demand for it, and jobs related to it have become at the forefront of the most sought-after jobs in the labor market. Learning this skill has thus become a golden opportunity to get job opportunities, and not just any job opportunities, but... distinguished opportunities with generous pay, whether as permanent jobs in companies or as freelance work that can be done from home...</p>
                        <p>So if you are among those looking to take advantage of this great opportunity to double your income by learning a fun, non-strenuous skill, and you are wondering where and how to start, then this book is your way to achieve that, by learning the wonderful <strong>Python</strong> programming language.</p>

                        <h3>What is the Python Language?</h3>
                        <p>So what is the <strong>Python</strong> language? And why did I choose it in this book as an entry point to the world of programming?</p>
                        <p>Python is a widely famous programming language, developed by the brilliant Dutch programmer <strong>Guido Van Rossum</strong>, who named it Python after the famous comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus". The first version of this language was released in 1991, and it has grown significantly to become one of the most famous and most used programming languages in the world.</p>

                        <h3>Why Python?</h3>
                        <p>With hundreds of programming languages available, perhaps the first question that comes to mind for anyone who decides to learn programming is: "Which programming language should I choose?", and my answer to them is: "Choose the <strong>Python</strong> language without hesitation," for several reasons, including:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Ease of Learning combined with Powerful Performance:</strong> The Python language is characterized by being a smooth, easy-to-learn language and ideal for beginners, in addition to being a very powerful language with high efficiency that can be used in complex and advanced fields, as it is used, for example, in advanced research at the American space agency NASA.</li>
                            <li><strong>High Demand and Generous Returns:</strong> Python is one of the most in-demand and common programming languages. It is used in major global companies including: Google, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Amazon, Uber... In addition, it is one of the highest-paid programming languages. For example, according to Glassdoor: the average annual salary for a Python programmer in the United States ranges from $80,000 to $120,000.</li>
                            <li><strong>Compatibility with Different Operating Systems and Versatility:</strong> The Python language is compatible with most known operating systems such as: iOS / Android / Linux / macOS / Windows and others... This powerful language is also characterized by the versatility of its uses: from automation, to statistics and data science, to artificial intelligence, to web application development, game development, etc... in addition to many other reasons that make us choose this wonderful programming language.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>About This Book</h3>
                        <p>I therefore present to you this comprehensive book on most of the basics of the <strong>Python</strong> language, which I have formulated in a simple, smooth way that can be understood by adults and children alike, and I have arranged it in a semi-interactive style, accompanied by code samples with a display of their execution results, and I have supplemented it with detailed, abundant explanations—resembling student notes—so that the reader can learn on their own, without the need to follow additional lessons and training courses. I have organized its titles in a flexible, methodical progression, making it two parts:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Part One...
