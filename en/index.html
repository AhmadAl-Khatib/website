                        <span>In 2015, we joined forces with a group of national figures and civil society activists during the Lebanon protests sparked by government negligence, which led to streets being flooded with waste. At that time, I personally submitted a proposal to the Lebanese government—supported by German funding—to address the waste crisis by converting waste into electrical energy in compliance with environmental standards, without imposing any cost on the Lebanese state. Unfortunately, sectarian quotas and widespread corruption within state institutions prevented the realization of this important development project for Lebanon, as has often been the case.</span>

                        <span>Regardless of the terminology—whether revolution, uprising, movement, or awakening—we were among the earliest and most dedicated participants in this broad national mobilization against corruption and political failure. When we observed deliberate and coordinated attempts to hijack this genuine grassroots wave and divert it from its rightful path, we took initiative and established the 17 October Popular Bloc. Our goal was to safeguard the movement’s principled character, and to confront systematic efforts to undermine the people’s legitimate demands for real reform. The bloc was chaired by Dr. Khaled Hanqir, and I served as its Secretary-General.</span>
